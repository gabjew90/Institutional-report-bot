# Ask-QC findings queue

Entries are appended by the nightly headless judge, one heading per graded
date. Entries are removed by the work session that ships or rejects them —
never by the judge.

## 2026-08-26

*(drained 2026-08-27 by the tool-status session, commits on the main
branch)*

- ~~1. validator-miss (IV figure, 13:41 turn)~~ — **predates-class**,
  not a miss: `unforced-market-data` deployed 19:15 UTC that day, five
  hours after the turn shipped. No firings and no shipped violations
  since deploy. The judge prompt now checks class age before bucketing
  a validator-miss.
- ~~2. regex-able, blocked on plumbing (GPS earnings confidence)~~ —
  **shipped** as validator class 10 `failed-tool-confidence`:
  per-tool status + grounding now reach the validators in production,
  the harness, and `scripts/validate_answer.py --tool-status`; the
  grounded-twin and hedged carve-outs are pinned by unit tests and
  fixture 47.
